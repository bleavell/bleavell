### Hi 👋

**Thanks for stopping by! I'm a behavioral ecologist fascinated by predator-prey interactions, sensory/cognitive ecology, and animal communication.**

I am fascinated by animal behavior but am particularly interested in how organisms’ biased perceptions of the world impact their ecology and evolution. This has led me to explore questions rooted in sensory ecology, animal communication and predator-prey interactions. My research links behavioral observations and natural history with theoretical and empirical tools to address a variety of questions.

When I'm not sciencing, I'm usually playing with my daughter, or my dogs, or more likely both. I also love to hike, fish, and bike.
