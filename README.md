### Hi 👋

**Thanks for stopping by! I'm a behavioral ecologist fascinated by predator-prey interactions, sensory/cognitive ecology, and animal communication.**

Currently, I'm a PhD candidate in Dr. Ximena Bernal's lab at Purdue University. I use modeling, observational and experimental approaches to understand how an adorable eavesdropping micropredator, the frog-biting midge (💉; Corethrellidae), impacts the sexual communication systems of their prey (🐸🐸🐸) and, indirectly, the foraging efficacy of other eavesdropping enemies (🦇🦇🦇). I've been fortunate to perform this work in the field and lab at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa, Panamá over the past several years. There's nothing more intoxicating than wandering tropical rainforests at night!

Previously I worked in Dr. Jesse Barber's lab at Boise State University studying the behavioral ecology and evolution of insectivorous bats and their prey.

When I'm not sciencing, I'm usually playing with my daughter, or my dogs, or more likely both. I also love to hike, fish, and bike.
